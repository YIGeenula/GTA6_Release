                    <p>On May 6, 2025, Rockstar Games unexpectedly released the second trailer for Grand Theft Auto VI—perhaps the most anticipated video game in industry history. This trailer gave us another glimpse into GTA VI's version of Vice City and introduced us to some of the key characters we'll be meeting when the game releases on May 26, 2026.</p>
                    <p>Below is our comprehensive guide to every main character revealed in Grand Theft Auto VI so far. We'll continue to update this article as Rockstar reveals more information about the inhabitants of Vice City.</p>

                            <p>Lucia is one half of the main protagonist duo in GTA VI. Born in Liberty City, she later moved to Leonida with her parents. She's described as someone who will always fight for her family—and it's that fight that landed her in jail in the first place.</p>
                            <p>Now free, Lucia wants to provide the "good life" to her family by any means necessary—and it seems she has a plan to do it. She represents the first female protagonist in the main GTA series.</p>

                            <p>His background reveals he grew up around "grifters and crooks," did a short tour in the army to distance himself from his troubled teenage years, and then returned to Leonida only to start working with local drug dealers.</p>
